# PokéWordle

Wordle like game with Pokémon made in the terminal.

Your main goal is to guess the Pokémon before running out of attempts.

There are two modes: With Pokémon from Kanto to Sinnoh and Unova to Paldea. You can choose which mode you want in the menu.

There are also 4 difficulties: Easy, Normal, Hard and Extreme. Depending on the difficulty you'll have more or less attempts, and the name
of the Pokémon to guess will be longer or shorter.

At the end of the game it will ask for a username. Based on this you'll have a history that will show your last attempts.

That's all for now. I hope you have fun with this little game :D
